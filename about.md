I stared in this world playing games in Spectrum 2048k (remember Tetris?) and Commodore Amiga 500... good old days! I took the first steps in programming with BASIC (in Spectrum) and later on in AMOS (did some small games using sprites, and made some Amiga demos too).

The first time I connected to the internet I used the fabulous US Robotics 56k with Slackware Linux (I had to send PAP commands to the modem) - had to compile the kernel to support some devices to make it work, but it worked like a charm.

In 1998 I started my career in Jurassic Park.

In 2006 I made a small linux distro to learn it's internals.

In 2013 I started making powerpoints.
