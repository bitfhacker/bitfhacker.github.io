title: Using a Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 on a Mac
---

The Apple keyboards, and specialy the Magic Mouse are very good and very pretty but I find them uncomfortable to use (my fingers can't find the keys while I'm typing).

I'm one of those guys that still loves the mechanical sound of the [IBM model M] keyboards, so as you can imagine, I had to buy a *real* keyboard to use it on my iMac. I put *real* in italic because I bought a **Microsoft** Wired Keyboard 600. :-P

You must be thinking why am I talking about this... Can you guess what happens when you connect a non Apple portuguese keyboard on an iMac?

Answer: portuguese accents don't work! Argh!

After some digging in the dirt, now I got it working. Now I can use ç ° ã í @ €  < > etecétera, escrever palavras exdrúúúxulas e exóticas como a Índia.

If you need to use a MS Wired Keyboard on a mac, use the keyboard layout that I share [here].
